<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Yuliya Vitkovska. I’m a recent project coordinator and financial analyst in a big project within Miratech.
   We work with European debt collection companies and help them to implement smart digital solutions. For instance, we're 
   working on the development of a technological platform specifically designed for scaling up the next-generation debt 
   management business. My main responsibility is to ensure that a particular project is progressing as it should. Specific
  responsibilities will include planning certain parts of the project, monitoring their progress, coordinating meetings, 
  and overseeing other members of the project team. It’s a great role for me as I am best at multitasking, communicating, 
  and organizing the team. The other part of my duties is creating financial reporting for the client on a regular monthly
  basis. I’ve always been passionate about finding smart solutions to analyze data, so my current activity is improving 
  financial processes within the business group and implementing Power BI reporting. </p>

<p>For the last 3 years, I’ve tried myself not only in coordinating activities but also as a project manager in several 
  business projects. For example, I managed the implementation of internal landing pages. Also, I helped the management 
  team to develop and create the base for implementing the PMO approach with the customer. I moderated a series of 
  workshops about introduction to Project Management and Risk Management. It gave me a clear vision of the scope and 
  values of the PM role.</p>

<p>Some people enjoy coordinating as it gives them more space to work on multiple projects without the pressure/
  responsibility for a successful delivery which lies with the project manager. But this is exactly what drives me. 
  Because of a lack of deep technical knowledge, my personal experience of being a project coordinator has been more 
  challenging, but I thrive in complexity as this tests my confidence and resilience. I see myself as a relentless 
  problem-solver, and I’m always looking for a new challenges. So, I am seeking an opportunity to work on a quickly 
  growing project with an interesting backlog, where I can grow as a project manager and expand my technical background.</p>
